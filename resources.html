			<h2>Rules of Procedure</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="modal-body">
		    <p>Each rule is self sufficient, unless altered by the Secretariat. No other procedural rules apply; should such a situation occur that is not addressed by the following rules, the Chair will be the ultimate authority on all procedural matters. Also note that all rules are subject to the discretion of the Chair.</p>
		    <p>1. Setting the Agenda: Setting the agenda is the first motion made during the opening session. A motion is to be made by any delegate to state the topic area to be debated. This motion requires a second. Once the motion is made, a provisional speakers list featuring three speakers for the motion and three speakers against the motion will be made. Once this is exhausted, voting shall occur (requiring a simple majority only). Following the setting of the agenda, a motion to proceed to the second topic area will only be entertained once the committee has either adopted or rejected a resolution on the first topic, or after debate had been adjourned. Please note that the above motion applies only if a delegate feels that the order of the topics proposed by the chair should be altered, i.e., if the second topic should be debated before the first one.</p>
		    <p>2. Speaker’s List: Once the agenda is determined, a continuously open Speaker’s List is established, to which delegates can add their names. This list will proceed in the order in which delegates are recognised by the Chair. This order will be followed for all debate on the topic area, unless superseded by any procedural motions (example, motions to move into a Moderated caucus, etc.) or reports. Speakers are allowed to speak on the topic in general, and may address any draft.</p>
		    <p>3. Speeches: Delegates cannot address a session without prior permission of the Chair. Off-topic or offensive remarks may result in being called to order by the chair.</p>
		    <p>4. Limitation of Speaking Time: The Chair may limit the time allotted to each speaker at his or her discretion. Delegates may motion to increase or decrease the speaking time, which will then be voted upon by the session. Upon exceeding their time limit, the delegate may be called to order without delay, though the Chair has the discretion be flexible with respect to this.</p>
		    <p>5. Yields: When a speaker delivers a non-controversial speech, two comments are order. If, however, the content of your speech needs further explanation or is highly controversial, you need to make use of yields. You may yield:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. To points of information,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Your time to the chair,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Your time to another delegate</p>
		    <p>6. Right of Reply: Any delegate whose personal or national integrity has been shown disrespect by that of another delegate, within the scope of formal debate, may request the Chair for the Right of Reply. If approved by the Secretariat, the respective delegate will be severely reprimanded and possibly excluded from further committee proceeding. Delegates are requested to use the Right of Reply with the utmost discretion. Frivolous use of the Right to Reply may lead to disciplinary action on the offending delegate administered by the chair.</p>
		    <p>7. Moderated Caucuses: The purpose of a moderated caucus is to facilitate substantive debate at critical junctures in the discussion. The approval of such a motion rests entirely in the hands of the committee staff and is not subject to appeal. During a moderated caucus, the Chair will suspend the Speaker’s List, and call on delegates to speak at his or her discretion. A moderated caucus is also opened for a specified purpose and a specified time.</p>
		    <p>8. Un-moderated Caucuses: This is essentially an informal discussion amongst delegates and has nonprocedural rules. Delegates generally use it to formulate working papers or resolutions. It must be motioned for, and it also requires a purpose and a specific time. The Speaker’s List is to be followed at all times, except for when it is interrupted by procedural motions, or other such issues. Following the end of such motions, the Speaker’s List will be resumed.</p>
		    <p>9. Voting<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Procedural Voting: Voting that occurs on any matter other than resolutions. All members are required to vote without abstentions. A simple majority is observed when there are more ‘Yes’ votes that ‘No’ votes, while two-thirds majority vote requires twice as many ‘Yes’ votes as ‘No’ votes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Substantive Voting: Substantive voting occurs on any matters pertaining directly to the resolution. Each vote may be either ‘Yes’, ‘No’ or ‘Abstain’. Any abstentions are considered as ‘not-voting’. Unless a roll-call vote is accepted, all matters are voted upon via placards. Only non-observer nations may vote on substantive matters.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Roll Call Voting: After debate is closed on a resolution, delegates may request a roll call vote (only for substantive votes).During Roll call vote, the Director will call countries in alphabetical order. During the rst round of voting, delegates may vote ‘Yes’, ‘No’, ‘Yes with Rights’, ‘No with Rights’, ‘Abstain’ or ‘Pass’.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. Yes with Rights/No with Rights – Delegates who vote in this manner reserve the right to explain his/her vote when voting against the policy of his/her country.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii. Pass – Delegates may pass their vote during the first round of voting. However, they will be required to vote either Yes or No (no abstentions) during the second round of voting. Note that Observer Nations may not vote on substantive matters, though they will be required to vote on procedural matters or any other such matters.</p>

			<h2>Resolution</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="modal-body">
		    <p>The final results of a discussion, writing and negotiation are resolutions – written suggestions for addressing a specific problem or issue. Resolutions, which are drafted by delegates and voted on by the committee, normally require a simple majority to pass (except in the Security Council).</p>
		    <p>Pre-ambulatory Clauses: The preamble of a draft resolution states the reasons for which the committee is addressing the topic and highlights past international action on the issue. Each clause begins with a present participle (called a perambulatory phrase) and ends with a comma (,). They can include: References to the UN charter, Citations of past UN resolutions or treaties on the topic under discussion, Recognition of the efforts of regional or non- governmental organization in dealing with the issue, General statements on the topic, its importance and impact.</p>
		    <p>Sample Pre-ambulatory Clauses include: Affirming, Deeply convinced, Further recalling, Noting with satisfaction, Alarmed by, Deeply disturbed, Guided by, Noting further, Approving, Deeply regretting, Having adopted, Noting with approval, Aware of, Desiring, Having considered, Observing, Bearing in mind, Expecting, Having examined, Reaffirming, Believing, Expressing its appreciation, Having heard, Realizing, Confident, Expressing its satisfaction, Having studied, Recalling, Contemplating, Fulfilling, Having considered, Recognizing, Declaring, Fully alarmed, Keeping in mind, Referring, Deeply concerned, Fully aware, Noting with regret, Seeking, Deeply Conscious, Further believing, Noting with deep concern ,Taking into account.</p>
		    <p>Operative Clauses: Operative clauses identify the actions or recommendations made in a resolution. Each operative clause begins with a verb (called an operative phrase) and ends with a semicolon (;).Operative clauses should be organized in a logical progression, with each containing a single idea or proposal, and are always numbered. If a clause requires further explanation, bulleted lists set off by letters or roman numerals can also be used. After the last operative clause, the resolution ends in a period (.).</p>

			<h2>Other Information</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="modal-body">
		    <p>Sponsors of a draft resolution are the principal authors of the document and agree with its substance. Almost always, there is more than one sponsor as countries must work together to create a widely agreeable language in order for the draft resolution to pass. Sponsors control a draft resolution and only the sponsors can approve immediate changes.</p>
		    <p>Signatories are countries that may or may not agree with the substance of the draft resolution but still wish to see it debated so that they can propose amendments. A certain percentage of the committee must be either sponsors or signatories to a draft resolution in order for it to be accepted.</p>
		    <p>Approved draft resolutions are modified through amendments. An amendment is a written statement that adds, deletes or revises an operative clause in a draft resolution. The amendment process is used to strengthen consensus on a resolution by allowing delegates to change certain sections.</p>
		    <p>There are 2 types of amendments:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. A friendly amendment is a change to the draft resolution that all sponsors agree with. After the amendment is signed by all of the draft resolution’s sponsors and approved by the committee director or president, it will be automatically incorporated into the resolution.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. An unfriendly amendment is a change that some or all of the draft resolution’s sponsors do not support and must be voted upon by the committee. The author(s) of the amendment will need to obtain a required number of signatories in order to introduce it. Prior to voting on the draft resolution, the committee votes on all unfriendly amendments.</p>

			<h2>Sample Resolution</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="modal-body">
		    <p>The Security Council,</p>
		    <p>Affirming that proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, as well as their means of delivery,* constitutes a threat to international peace and security,</p>
		    <p>Reaffirming, in this context, the Statement of its President adopted at the Council’s meeting at the level of Heads of State and Government on 31 January 1992 (S/23500), including the need for all Member States to fulfil their obligations in relation to arms control and disarmament and to prevent proliferation in all its aspects of all weapons of mass destruction,</p>

		    <p>Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,</p>
		    <p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Decides that all States shall refrain from providing any form of support to non-State actors that attempt to develop, acquire, manufacture, possess, transport, transfer or use nuclear, chemical or biological weapons and their means of delivery;</p>
